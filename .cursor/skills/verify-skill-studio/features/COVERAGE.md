# Skill Studio - Feature Coverage Matrix

This matrix lists every user-facing surface in Skill Studio and its documentation/verification status.

## Coverage Legend

- ✅ **Fully Mapped** - Complete feature documentation with all H2 sections (sub-features, driving, gotchas, branches, benchmarks, end state)
- 📝 **Partially Mapped** - Feature documented but needs expansion (missing sub-features, branches, or benchmarks)
- ⚠️ **Mapped but Unproven** - Documentation exists but no Playwright verification or evidence captured
- ❌ **Not Mapped** - No documentation yet (should not appear in this final matrix)

## Coverage Summary

### By Documentation Status

- **Fully Mapped**: 14 surfaces (all primary views, skill detail, operations, sub-features)
- **Partially Mapped**: 0 (all surfaces expanded to full depth)
- **Not Mapped**: 0 (all surfaces documented)

### By Verification Status

- **Proven with Evidence**: 0 (none yet verified with Playwright)
- **Mapped but Unproven**: 14 (all documented, verification pending)

### Expansion Priority

**All primary surfaces now at full depth.** No expansion priorities remain for documentation.

Next priority: **Verification** - driving documented flows with Playwright and capturing evidence.

### Testing Recommendations

1. **Launch/Doctor verification** - Verify Tauri dev server starts, app loads
2. **Smoke test each view** - Navigate to every primary view, capture screenshots
3. **Critical path verification**:
   - Add skill (dotagents source, GitHub single skill)
   - Install from SkillStore browse
   - Update skill from Home
   - Park unused skill
   - Create pack from selection
4. **Complex flows** (defer to dedicated verification runs):
   - Fork/unfork/pull upstream
   - Multi-skill GitHub repo install
   - Trial expiry + restore
   - Skill comparison
   - Activity event restore

## Notes

- All feature files follow the same H2 structure: Sub-features, How to get to it, Driving it with Playwright, Gotchas, Branches, Benchmarks & improvement, Observable end state
- Playwright selectors provided are best-effort; actual implementation may use data-testid attributes
- "Proven" status requires evidence (screenshots, test results, logs) captured during verification runs
- Feature flag dependencies noted (e.g. packs behind `skill-packs` flag)
- Platform dependencies noted (macOS-only features like native editor picker)
