# Skill Studio Feature Map

Comprehensive documentation of every user-facing surface, workflow, and interaction in Skill Studio - a Tauri 2.x desktop app for managing AI coding assistant skills across Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode, and pi.

## Purpose

This feature map provides:

1. **Complete coverage** - Every view, modal, dialog, and interaction documented
2. **Playwright driving instructions** - Selectors and code examples for automated verification
3. **Branch documentation** - Happy paths, empty states, failures, cancellations, and edge cases
4. **Performance hooks** - Observable metrics, current instrumentation, improvement levers
5. **End-state verification** - Invariants and observable outcomes to prove correctness

## Coverage Overview

### Documentation Status

- ✅ **Fully Mapped**: 14 surfaces - all primary views, skill detail, operations, and sub-features documented to full depth
- 📝 **Partially Mapped**: 0 - all surfaces expanded with complete sub-features, branches, benchmarks, and end states
- ❌ **Not Mapped**: 0 - every surface has documentation

See **[COVERAGE.md](./COVERAGE.md)** for the complete matrix of all surfaces, modals, sub-features, and their verification status.

### Verification Status

- **Proven**: 0 (none yet verified with Playwright + evidence)
- **Mapped but Unproven**: 14 (all documented, Playwright examples provided, verification pending)

## How to Use This Map

### For Verification Engineers

1. **Pick a feature file** - Each markdown file is one user-facing surface or workflow
2. **Read "How to get to it"** - User's perspective on accessing the feature
3. **Follow "Driving it with Playwright"** - Code examples and selectors
4. **Check "Branches"** - Test all documented paths (happy, empty, failure, cancel)
5. **Capture evidence** - Screenshots, logs, test results per "Observable end state"
6. **Validate benchmarks** - Measure latency, success rates per "Benchmarks & improvement"

### For Developers

1. **Reference when changing behavior** - Feature files document current state
2. **Update after refactors** - Keep selectors and flows in sync with code
3. **Add new features** - Follow existing H2 structure (sub-features, driving, gotchas, branches, benchmarks, end state)
4. **Check gotchas** - Understand edge cases and constraints before modifying

### For Product/QA

1. **Audit completeness** - COVERAGE.md shows which surfaces are documented vs gaps
2. **Review critical paths** - Home → Add Skill → Install is the most common flow
3. **Identify risk areas** - Complex flows (fork/unfork, trial restore, multi-skill install) need extra scrutiny
4. **Track verification progress** - "Proven" status tracks which features have been driven end-to-end

## Feature File Structure

Every feature file follows this template:

1. **Sub-features** - Breakdown of components and capabilities
2. **How to get to it (user POV)** - Navigation path from app launch
3. **Driving it with Playwright** - Code examples, selectors, click sequences
4. **Gotchas** - Edge cases, constraints, platform dependencies, feature flags
5. **Branches** - Happy path, empty/first-run, duplicate/conflict, failure, cancellation, loading states
6. **Benchmarks & improvement** - Observable metrics, current instrumentation, suggested measurements, improvement levers
7. **Observable end state** - Invariants and outcomes to verify correctness

## Critical Paths (Priority for Verification)

1. **Install flow** - Add Skill sheet → type source → submit → toast success → skill shows in sidebar
2. **Browse & install** - SkillStore Browse tab → search → click card → install from detail
3. **Update skill** - Home Updates group → "Pull latest" → toast success
4. **Park unused** - Home Unused group → "Park" → skill moves to parked
5. **Create pack** - Skills view → Select → check skills → "Create pack" → enter name → pack created
6. **Fork & edit** - Skill detail → "Fork" → edit markdown → save → changes persist

## Testing Strategy

### Phase 1: Smoke Test (Launch + Doctor)

- Verify Tauri dev server starts (`npm run tauri dev`)
- Doctor checks: port 1420 responds, tmux session alive, node process owns port
- Navigate to each primary view, capture one screenshot per view

### Phase 2: Core Workflows

- Install skill (dotagents, GitHub single, skills.sh)
- Update skill (Home "Pull latest")
- Remove skill (detail overflow menu)
- Park/unpark skill
- Search skills (sidebar + Skills view filter)

### Phase 3: Advanced Workflows

- Multi-skill GitHub repo install
- Fork, edit, unfork flow
- Create pack, publish pack
- Trial mode + restore after expiry
- Skill comparison
- Activity event restore

### Phase 4: Edge Cases & Failures

- Install duplicate skill (warning toast)
- Update without internet (error toast)
- Fork plugin skill (button hidden)
- Park project-scoped skill (error: not in shared folder)
- Enable harness with linked root (Convert dialog required)

## Expansion Priorities

**All surfaces now at full depth.** No expansion priorities remain.

Next focus: **Verification** - driving documented flows with Playwright, capturing evidence (screenshots, logs, test results), and marking features as "Proven" in COVERAGE.md.

## Related Documentation

- `../../SKILL.md` - Verification skill entry point (Launch, Doctor, Drive, Evidence, Cleanup)
- `../../../docs/agent-skill-conventions.md` - agentskills.io spec, per-agent discovery paths, invocation control
- `../../../apps/desktop/src-tauri/src/skills/` - Rust backend implementation
- `../../../apps/desktop/src/components/` - React frontend components

## Maintenance

- **On code changes**: Update feature files to match new behavior (selectors, flows, branches)
- **On new features**: Create new feature file or expand existing one, add to COVERAGE.md
- **On verification runs**: Mark features as "Proven" in COVERAGE.md, link to evidence
- **On refactors**: Re-verify affected features, update selectors if UI structure changed
