The skill is "${input.skillName}", running under ${input.harness} in this review, and otherwise deployed to: ${deploymentsLine}.

Judge it against two kinds of rules:

Specification rules (report as [spec]) - enforced by Skill Studio's validator, a violation blocks the skill from being marked spec-compliant:
- Frontmatter \`name\` is 1-64 characters, lowercase a-z0-9 and hyphens only, with no leading, trailing, or consecutive hyphens, and matches the skill's folder name exactly.
- Frontmatter \`description\` is required, non-empty, and at most 1024 characters.
- Frontmatter \`compatibility\`, when present, is at most 500 characters.
- The body stays under 500 lines.

Quality recommendations (report as [quality]) - not spec violations, but worth flagging:
- Frontmatter \`description\` is written in third person, states WHEN to use the skill and what it does, and includes trigger phrases a user or model would actually say.
- Anything approaching the 500-line body limit should split into linked files under the skill folder (progressive disclosure) rather than staying inlined.
- Prefer linking to files under the skill folder over inlining their contents.
- No secrets (API keys, tokens, credentials) anywhere in the file.
- Instructions are written for a model: imperative, specific, and unambiguous.
- Examples are included wherever the task is ambiguous without one.

Here is the SKILL.md to review:

${fence}markdown
${input.skillMd}
${fence}

Respond with exactly this structure:

## Findings

Up to 8 bullets, ordered by impact. Each bullet reads: "**[spec|quality] [high|medium|low]** what is wrong — why it matters".

## Verdict

One line summarizing whether this skill is ready to ship as-is.

${PROPOSED_HEADING}

Only include this section if changes are worth making. If so, follow the heading with ONE fenced block wrapping the complete revised SKILL.md - frontmatter included, nothing omitted, no placeholders. Wrap the proposed file in a fence of exactly ${fence.length} backticks (${fence}markdown … ${fence}), because the file itself contains shorter fences. If no change is worth making, write "No changes proposed." instead of the block.`;
