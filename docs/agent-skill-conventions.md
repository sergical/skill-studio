# Agent skill conventions

Reference for how each first-class agent discovers, invokes, and controls skills,
and what the agentskills.io spec requires. Verified against the linked docs on
2026-08-22. Re-verify a row before relying on it if the agent shipped a major
release since then.

## agentskills.io SKILL.md spec

| Field           | Required | Constraint                                                                                             |
| --------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `name`          | yes      | 1–64 chars; `a-z`, `0-9`, `-` only; no leading/trailing/consecutive hyphens; equals the directory name |
| `description`   | yes      | 1–1024 chars; what the skill does and when to use it                                                   |
| `license`       | no       | License name or a bundled license file reference                                                       |
| `compatibility` | no       | 1–500 chars; environment requirements                                                                  |
| `metadata`      | no       | Arbitrary string-keyed map                                                                             |
| `allowed-tools` | no       | Space-separated pre-approved tools (experimental)                                                      |

Directory layout: `SKILL.md` (required), optional `scripts/`, `references/`, `assets/`.
The spec has **no** invocation-control fields; those are agent extensions (below).
Reference validator: `skills-ref validate ./my-skill`.

Skill Studio enforces these rules in `src-tauri/src/skills/frontmatter.rs`
(`validate_skill`) and reports failures as `spec_violations`.

## What agents do with a spec violation

Measured 2026-10-01: Claude Code 2.1.287, Codex 0.159.2, OpenCode 1.18.30, pi 0.99.1.
Cursor: blocked at login; Grok Build: not installed.

`specViolationSeverity` in `packages/lib/src/skill-health.ts` encodes this (error, warning, note).
Re-check it when an agent changes.

## Invocation control and per-agent off settings

Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode and pi auto-invoke a skill by default when its
description matches the task. Grok Build's model-side control is not verified
yet (see the "unknown" cell below). [Skill uses](#skill-uses) lists
how each harness records a typed command and a model call.

| Agent       | Explicit invocation | Restrict model auto-invoke                                                                     | Agent setting that hides a skill (Skill Studio reads it)                         |

| Claude Code | `/name [args]`      | frontmatter `disable-model-invocation: true` (user only); `user-invocable: false` (model only) | `~/.claude/settings.json` → `skillOverrides: {"<name>": "off"}`                  |
| Codex       | `$name`, `/skills`  | sidecar `agents/openai.yaml` → `policy.allow_implicit_invocation: false`                       | `~/.codex/config.toml` → `[[skills.config]] path = "…/SKILL.md" enabled = false` |

Frontmatter-based controls (`disable-model-invocation`, `user-invocable`) edit the
Universal SKILL.md, so they apply to every agent that reads that folder or a symlink
to it. Config-based controls for Codex and OpenCode apply to one harness.

### Other Claude Code frontmatter fields

`allowed-tools`, `disallowed-tools`, `context: fork`, `agent`, `background`, `paths`
(globs that gate auto-loading), `model`, `effort`, `argument-hint`, `arguments`,
`hooks`, `shell`, `when_to_use`, `metadata`, `license`, `compatibility`.

## Scope and destination

Choose a scope and a destination separately:

| Choice      | Values                 | Meaning                                                                                                                                   |
| ----------- | ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Scope       | Global, Project        | Global writes below the user's home directory. Project writes below one selected project.                                                 |
| Destination | Universal, Per harness | Universal writes one canonical deployment to `.agents/skills/<name>`. Per harness writes a separate copy to each selected harness folder. |

Global Universal deployments go in `~/.agents/skills`. Project Universal deployments
go in `.agents/skills`. Codex, OpenCode, pi, Cursor, and Grok Build read these paths
directly. Claude Code can use a per-skill link to the same deployment. Selecting these
readers changes visibility. It does not create more deployments.

Per harness never writes `.agents/skills` and never creates links back to Universal.
Each selected harness gets its own directory copy. Each copy has an independent
lifecycle and can differ from the others. Only the Copy method supports Per harness.
dotagents and skills.sh, including Store installs, support Universal only.

### Parking (disable globally, for every harness)

Parking is Skill Studio's own global disable: it moves a skill's Universal
deployment from `~/.agents/skills/<name>` to `~/.agents/skills-parked/<name>`
(a rename, not a copy), removing a per-skill Claude Code symlink first if one
exists. Every harness that reads the Universal folder loses the skill at once;
unparking reverses both steps. The registry (`~/.agents/skill-studio.json`)
records `parked: {name: {parked_at, source_kind, claude_link}}` so unparking
knows whether to recreate a Claude Code link.

Because parking only moves the Universal folder, a `sync`/`update`/reinstall run
while a skill is parked can recreate `~/.agents/skills/<name>` on its own -
Skill Studio still shows the skill as parked (from the registry record), but
flags it as `parked-but-reinstalled` until it's unparked. Unparking then
reconciles the two copies: if the reinstalled copy is byte-identical to the
parked one, the parked copy is simply discarded; otherwise it's moved to
`~/.agents/skills-trash/<name>-<timestamp>` rather than silently overwriting
either copy.

### Agent settings that hide a skill (read only)

Park is the only way Skill Studio turns a skill off. It never writes an
agent's own config file. It does read these settings and shows them on the
skill page as "Hidden by <agent> setting", with an "Open" action for the file:

- **Claude Code**: `~/.claude/settings.json` → `skillOverrides.<name> = "off"`.
- **Codex**: `~/.codex/config.toml` → `[[skills.config]] path = "…/SKILL.md" enabled = false`,
  matched by the skill's canonical SKILL.md path. Park and unpark leave this
  file byte-identical.
- **OpenCode**: `~/.config/opencode/opencode.json` → `permission.skill.<name-or-glob> = "deny"`.
- **pi, Cursor, Grok Build**: no per-skill setting. Park is the only off.

A skill a setting hides stays hidden after unpark: edit the file to change it.
Older builds also wrote these files and, for Claude Code, removed the per-skill
link. Scans still report those leftovers (`disabled_by`), and the journal still
loads their events.

### Skill uses

Each skill use has one of three triggers. The names follow Grok Build's own
telemetry (`SkillTrigger` in xai-org/grok-build
`crates/codegen/xai-grok-telemetry/src/events/skills.rs`):

- **user**: the person typed the skill command (`/name`, `$name`, `/skill:name`).
- **agent**: the model called a skill tool.
- **file read**: the model read a `SKILL.md` with a file or shell tool. Count it
  only when the path is inside a known skill root. The skill list in the
  instructions names every `SKILL.md` path on every turn, so text that only
  mentions a path is not a use.

Checked on 2026-09-16 against harness source, local history, and one live CLI
run per harness. `docs/research/harness-primitives.md` section 7 has the
evidence.

Claude Code adds an `isMeta` user message that starts with
`Base directory for this skill:` after both the typed command and the `Skill`
call. It is part of the same use; do not count it again.

## Update check

`src-tauri/src/skills/skill_update_check.rs` compares each global-scope,
GitHub-backed skill's installed commit against the newest commit `gh api`
reports for its path, on a 6-hour timer plus a manual "Check now" (Issues
view). For a dotagents skill the installed commit comes straight from
`agents.lock`; for a skills.sh skill it's the newest commit at or before the
lock entry's `updatedAt` (cached until `updatedAt` changes, so a lock entry
that hasn't moved never re-queries its baseline). Results persist at
`<app data dir>/skill-studio/update-check.json` so a full snapshot rebuild can
read them without shelling out. Access is read-only (`gh api repos/.../commits`)
through the user's own `gh` CLI login; the app stores no tokens itself, and
"Update" runs the tool that owns the skill (`npx @sentry/dotagents add|install`
or `npx skills update`) rather than writing to `agents.toml`, `agents.lock`, or
`.skill-lock.json` directly.

## Fork / Pull upstream / Un-fork

A dotagents or skills.sh skill's local edits don't survive that CLI's own
lifecycle: dotagents `install` overwrites the folder outright (`sync`
preserves edits, but `install`/re-adding does not), and a folder `sync`
finds with neither a `[[skills]]` row nor a lock table gets silently adopted
as `source = "path:.agents/skills/<name>"` rather than kept as the skill the
user meant to edit. "Fork" (`src-tauri/src/skills/skill_fork.rs`) detaches a
skill from its owning ledger so edits stick: it snapshots the current folder,
removes the skill from its ledger (`npx @sentry/dotagents remove` or
`npx skills remove`), restores the folder if the removal deleted it, and
records a `ForkRecord` in `~/.agents/skill-studio.json`. Wildcard dotagents
entries (`name = "*"`, no per-skill manifest row) are refused in v1 - forking
one by name first requires adding a named row for it, which dotagents
doesn't offer without a fresh `add`.

"Pull upstream" never merges automatically: it compares the skill's
last-synced snapshot (`base`), its current on-disk copy (`mine`), and a
freshly fetched upstream copy at the latest commit (`theirs`), file by file:
unchanged-in-mine takes theirs; unchanged-in-theirs keeps mine; a text file
that differs on all three sides gets git-style conflict markers written into
it, and the file is opened in the user's editor for manual resolution; a
binary file that differs on all three sides keeps mine and is flagged. Files
added or removed upstream are added or removed locally when the local copy
hadn't diverged.
The snapshot always advances to the new upstream commit afterward, even when
there were conflicts, so the fork's `base_commit` stays a true "last pulled"
marker. The upstream copy is fetched read-only via
`gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/tarball/<sha>`, extracted with `tar`, and never
writes back to GitHub or to the owning CLI's own files.

"Un-fork" discards local edits and reinstalls the skill from its recorded
origin (`declared_ref`, if any, for a dotagents fork), then drops the fork
record and snapshot - the frontend confirms this destructively first.

## Lifecycle targets and safety

Each discovered deployment has a stable `deployment_id`, destination, backing
relationship, owner kind, and mutability. A mutating command receives one exact
`deployment_id` or one explicit `owner_id`. If a scope has more than one mutable
owner, the command does not select one by skill name. Before writing, the backend
reloads the snapshot and confirms that the id still matches the path, scope, and
destination.

An owner-wide update or removal affects only deployments with that owner id. Global
and Project ledgers have different owner ids. A Per harness Copy has its own lifecycle
and does not inherit a Universal ledger. Park and unpark accept only the canonical
Global Universal deployment. They do not move Project deployments or Per harness
copies.

Skill Studio can change deployments owned by skills.sh, dotagents, Copy, or a fork.
Plugin, in-repo, manual, wildcard-dotagents, and ambiguous deployments are read-only.
Lifecycle commands reject read-only deployments. They do not guess an owner or
delete a path found during discovery. Source reads, update checks, plugin-cache
enumeration, and GitHub fetches do not write to those sources. Managed updates and
removals run the owning CLI instead of editing its lock or manifest files.

### Compatibility identifiers

The scanner and existing DTOs can still use the machine value `shared` for the
Universal `.agents/skills` root. Existing fields such as
`claude_reads_shared_folder`, `shared_via_whole_dir_link`, event kinds such as
`explode_shared_dir`, and internal `shared-root` relationship names remain on the
wire for compatibility. UI copy must call this destination Universal. These
compatibility values do not define another destination.

## Add skill

The "Add skill" sheet (`src/components/AddSkill/AddSkillSheet.tsx`, backend
`skills/skill_add.rs`) accepts a free-text source - `owner/repo`,
`owner/repo/<path>`, a `github.com` URL (bare, `/tree/<ref>/<path>`, or
`/blob/<ref>/<path>/SKILL.md`), a `skills.sh/<owner>/<repo>/<skill>` URL,
`git:<url>` or a bare `*.git` URL, or an absolute/`~/` local path - parsed by
`src/lib/skill-source-parse.ts` into a `ParsedSkillSource`. One of three
methods installs it: **dotagents** (`npx -y @sentry/dotagents add`, tracked in
`agents.toml`/`agents.lock`), **skills.sh** (tracked in `.skill-lock.json`;
GitHub sources only), or **Copy** (untracked, with no update ledger).

dotagents and skills.sh always install one Universal deployment. A skills.sh install
uses its Universal target. It does not use a direct reader such as Codex as a proxy
target. The install can also request a Claude Code link. Copy can install one
Universal deployment or separate Per harness copies. For Per harness, the backend
copies the fetched source into each selected harness path and rejects an empty
selection. Project scope uses the same layout below the selected project.

## Packs

A share pack (`src-tauri/src/skills/skill_pack.rs`) bundles a chosen set of
skill deployments into one dotagents-compatible repo under
`~/.agents/packs/<name>/`, for handing to another machine or another person.
Selecting rows in any `SkillListTable` and clicking "Create pack" in the
selection bar (`src/store/appStore.ts`'s `selectedSkillPaths`, keyed by each
row's deployment path) builds:

- `skills/<name>/` - a full bundled copy of **every** member, bundled from
  its exact selected deployment path - even one managed by dotagents,
  skills.sh, or a fork, so the pack still works if the origin repo moves or
  disappears.
- `agents.toml` - a `[[skills]]` row for provenance on every **managed**
  member (dotagents, skills.sh, or fork - only when its path is the shared
  `~/.agents/skills/<name>` root; a project deployment or plugin-cache copy
  is always treated as manual), with `source`, `path`, and `ref` (the fork's
  or skills.sh's resolved `installed_commit`, falling back to a dotagents
  declared ref, or omitted for an unpinned/wildcard entry).
- `README.md` - generated install instructions for both `npx -y
@sentry/dotagents add <owner>/<repo> --all` and `npx skills add
<owner>/<repo>`.

`create_skill_pack`/`update_skill_pack` commit the tree with `git`
locally only; `update_skill_pack` rebuilds from the pack's already-recorded
members and only commits when the tree actually changed. **Publishing is
never automatic**: `publish_skill_pack` confirms with a native
`tauri_plugin_dialog` message box (`PublishConfirm`) right before it shells
out to `gh repo create ... --push` (first publish) or `git push origin HEAD`
(every publish after `repo` is recorded) - the app never creates a repo or
pushes on its own, and a cancelled dialog returns `Err("Publish cancelled")`
before any `gh`/`git` call. `delete_skill_pack` only removes the local
registry entry and directory; it never touches GitHub.

Importing a pack (the Add-skill sheet's "Pack" method, shown for GitHub
sources) reads the repo's `agents.toml` read-only via `gh api -H "Accept:
application/vnd.github.raw" repos/<owner>/<repo>/contents/agents.toml`, then
validates every `[[skills]]` row (name, source, path, ref) before running any
command - one invalid row, or more than 200 rows, refuses the whole import
with nothing installed. It then runs `npx -y @sentry/dotagents add
<owner>/<repo> --all` for the bundled `skills/` tree, and only then one
`dotagents add <source> --name <name> --ref <ref>` per remaining `[[skills]]`
row - skipping any row whose name `--all` already bundled, since a pack now
bundles every managed member alongside its row. A row that fails to resolve
is reported but doesn't abort the rest of the import. None of this ever edits
`~/.agents/agents.toml`, `agents.lock`, or `.skill-lock.json` directly - a
pack only ever writes its own generated `agents.toml` under
`~/.agents/packs/<name>/`, and imports go through the same CLIs "Add skill"
already uses.

## Trials (removed)

The 24-hour trial install was removed in #285. There is no time-boxed install
mode anymore. To switch a skill off without deleting it, use park
(`park_skill`/`unpark_skill`, `src-tauri/src/skills/skill_park.rs`) - see
[park-fork-trial.md](action-map/park-fork-trial.md). A `trials` map left over
in `~/.agents/skill-studio.json` from before #285 round-trips unchanged and is
otherwise ignored.

## Headless runs

Skill Studio's local harness runner (`src-tauri/src/skills/skill_agent_runner.rs`)
starts each harness as a one-shot subprocess and parses its streaming JSON-lines
stdout. Binaries are resolved with `$SHELL -lc 'command -v <bin>'` (fallback
`/bin/zsh`) and cached per harness, since the app's own `PATH` doesn't see the
user's shell config.

- **Claude Code**: `claude -p "<prompt>" --output-format stream-json --verbose
--permission-mode <mode> [--resume <id>]`. Lines:
  `{"type":"system","subtype":"init",...,"session_id"}`;
  `{"type":"assistant","message":{"content":[{"type":"text","text":...} |

  Ignore `system/hook_*`, `rate_limit_event`, `thinking`. Skill loaded = a
  `tool_use` named `Skill` whose `input.skill` equals the skill name.
- **Codex**: `codex exec --json --skip-git-repo-check -s <read-only|workspace-write>
[-C <cwd>] "<prompt>"`; resume: `codex exec resume <thread_id> --json "<prompt>"`
  (no `-C`; set the process cwd instead). No `-a` flag. Lines:
  `{"type":"thread.started","thread_id":"…"}`, `turn.started`,
  `{"type":"item.started"|"item.completed","item":{"id","type":"agent_message","text"}
| {"type":"command_execution","command","aggregated_output","exit_code"} |
{"type":"reasoning"} | {"type":"file_change",...} | {"type":"error","message"}}`,
  `{"type":"turn.completed","usage":{...}}`, `turn.failed`. Skill loaded = any
  `command_execution.command` containing `/<skill-name>/SKILL.md`, else unknown.
  Final text = last completed `agent_message`.
- **pi**: `pi -p --mode json "<prompt>"` (cwd = process cwd; resume `--session <id>`).
  Lines: `{"type":"session","id":"…","cwd"}`, `message_update` with
  `assistantMessageEvent.type=="text_delta"` and `.delta`, `tool_execution_start`
  `{toolName, args}` / `tool_execution_end` `{toolName, result}`, `turn_end` with
  `message.content[]` (text blocks), `agent_end`, `agent_settled`. Skill loaded = a
  `read` tool whose `args.path` ends with or contains `/<skill-name>/SKILL.md`, else
  unknown. Final text = concatenated text blocks of the last `turn_end`.
- **OpenCode**: `opencode2 run --standalone --format json --auto [--session <id>]
"<prompt>"` (binary is `opencode2`, the v2 CLI; no `--dir` flag, cwd is the process
  cwd; `--standalone` bypasses the shared `opencode2 serve --service` background
  service, which hangs every run with no output when wedged). JSONL `type` values:
  `step_start | text | tool | step_finish`, each carrying a `part`. Session id comes
  from the top-level `sessionID`, first seen. `type=="text"` → assistant text from
  `part.text`. `type=="tool"` (`part.type=="tool"`) → one tool call per
  `part.callID`/`part.id`, deduped across the CLI's pending/running/completed
  re-prints of the same part; skill loaded = `part.tool=="skill"` naming this run's
  skill, or `part.tool=="read"` of that skill's `SKILL.md`. `type=="step_finish"` →
  `part.cost`/`part.tokens`, best effort, feeds the run's `Finished` cost. Read-only
  is not enforced for OpenCode: nine live probes of v0.0.0-beta-17498 found the CLI
  ignores `OPENCODE_CONFIG`, and cwd-scoped permission denies for `edit`/`write`/
  `patch`/`multiedit`/`apply_patch` never blocked `patch` from creating a file, so
  every OpenCode run gets workspace write access regardless of the requested mode.

Every run emits one `SkillAgentEvent` per parsed line (or per lifecycle step) on
`"skill-agent://event"`, and always exactly one terminating `Finished` event, even
on cancellation or a crash before any output.

## Navigation

The app shell keeps two different jobs apart: the sidebar (`Sidebar.tsx`) holds
_places_ - Home, Skills, Activity, Packs, and Parked - and the Skills view's
filter bar (`SkillListFilterBar.tsx`) holds _filters_ over that one list:
scope (all/global/project), harness, source, a coverage toggle, and a
free-text query. There is no separate page per scope, per harness, or per
issue kind; every one of those is a value of `SkillListFilter`
(`src/lib/skill-list-filter.ts`), applied to the same `SkillsView`. Deep
links (Home's "N missing" card, the sidebar's Parked row) work by handing
`ActiveView`'s `{ kind: "skills", filter }` a partial filter, not by routing
to a different view.

Plugin-shipped skills are a _source_ of skills, not a managed primitive of
their own: `source_kind: "plugin"` is one value of the Skills view's Source
filter, on the same list and the same `SkillListTable`/`SkillCoverageMatrix`
as every other skill - see `ownSkillsView`/`pluginSkillsView` in
`skill-plugin-partition.ts`. There is no standalone "Plugins" page.

Health issues (`collectDashboardIssues`, `src/lib/skill-health.ts`) are
surfaced on Home's "Needs attention" card and reachable from the Skills view
via `filter.issue`. The kinds are: `parked-but-reinstalled`, `duplicate`,
`broken-symlink`, `spec-violation` (error-severity agentskills.io violations, see
`specViolationSeverity`), `spec-warning`, and `lock-only`. Two things that look like
issues deliberately are not: a skill that has never been invoked (noise, not
something worth fixing for every skill) and a skill with an update available
(that's the "Updates" section on Home, a routine action, not a health
problem).
