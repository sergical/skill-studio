# Events and history

This area is the append-only event log every mutating command writes to.
It covers the backups the log keeps, the restore it offers, and the reconcile pass that repairs a crash.

Commands: `list_skill_events`, `restore_skill_event`, the event store (`<app_data>/events.sqlite3`, `<app_data>/backups/<event-id>/`), the startup reconcile loop, the eight-command journal rule.

UI entry points: `SkillHistorySection.tsx` (Restore, Reveal in Finder), `SkillActivityView.tsx` / `ActivityFilters.tsx` / `ActivityYear.tsx` / `ActivityDayDetails.tsx`.

## Current state

The event store is SQLite via `rusqlite`, in WAL mode, at `<app_data_dir>/events.sqlite3`.
It sits deliberately outside `~/.agents` (`docs/spec-event-store.md:26-31`).
One `events` table holds a ULID id, timestamp, kind, skill, harness, scope, a JSON payload, a JSON inverse (`NULL` means not restorable), a backup dir, a status (`pending`/`done`/`failed`/`interrupted`), and a `reverted_by` self-reference (`docs/spec-event-store.md:41-54`).
Backups live under `backups/<event-id>/`, with a `manifest.json` mapping original paths to relative backup paths and a SHA-256 fingerprint per top-level path (`docs/spec-event-store.md:32-36`).

Every journaling command follows the same five phases (`docs/spec-event-store.md:99-115`).
It allocates an id before touching disk.
It backs up anything about to be destroyed or rewritten, with the manifest fsynced first.
It records a pending row.
It performs the mutation with create-before-delete staging.
It finishes `done` or `failed`.

Eight commands across the codebase follow this: `make_independent_copy`, `repair_skill_link`, `set_deployment_enabled`, `set_shared_harness_skill_enabled`, `materialize_harness_root`, `materialize_harness_root_then_disable`, `apply_skill_frontmatter_repair`, and `restore_skill_event` itself.
Everything else in the map — `set_harness_enabled`, `set_plugin_enabled`, `set_skill_invocation`, `write_installed_skill_md_if_unchanged`, `park_skill`, `unpark_skill`, `update_skill`, `remove_skill` — writes without a journal row.

`list_skill_events` (`event_commands.rs:65`) is a plain read, guarded by the event store's own mutex.
It returns up to `limit` (default 200) events with restorability flags.
It has no direct test.

`restore_skill_event` (`event_commands.rs:84`) is the one command every History Restore button calls.
It takes `ForkMutationLock`.
It refuses an explode restore while any exploded skill is still disabled, and it always refuses `make_independent_copy` with `force`.
Inside the store (`event_store.rs:378-472`) it backs up the current destination under `backups/<restore_id>/`, inserts a new pending restore event, applies the inverse (`RecreateSymlink`, `RemoveSymlink`, `MoveBack`, `RestoreBackup`, or the multi-path `UndistributeFromShared`), finishes the row, and claims `reverted_by` on the original row it restored.
A restore is itself journaled — restore-of-restore is legal, and `force` never destroys the only copy of anything, because step 2 preserves the drifted bytes in the restore event's own backup (`docs/spec-event-store.md:140-150`).
Duplicate or concurrent restores are blocked by a transactional claim: `UPDATE events SET reverted_by = ?new WHERE id = ?target AND reverted_by IS NULL`; zero rows updated means another restore already won (`docs/spec-event-store.md:126-131`).

Startup reconcile (`open_event_store` at `lib.rs:17`, called from setup at `lib.rs:130`) opens the database and flips every `pending` row to `interrupted`.
That is the only way a pending row can survive, since commands are synchronous within one process.
Three repairers then read the store and fix the filesystem: `reconcile_interrupted_independent_copy` and its restore counterpart, `reconcile_interrupted_convert_then_disable`, and `reconcile_interrupted_frontmatter_repair` (`lib.rs:46-98`).
Failures are printed, never fatal.

An `interrupted` row keeps its backup and renders in History with a warning and a Restore button.
Restore uses the recorded fingerprints to tell whether the mutation completed, partially applied, or never ran (`docs/spec-event-store.md:121-125`).
A drift-guard refusal — the live content no longer matches the fingerprint recorded in the original event's inverse — surfaces as a dialog offering force-restore, and states that the drifted content will itself be backed up (`docs/spec-event-store.md:170-172`).

Nothing in `SkillActivityView.tsx` calls a Tauri command directly; the heatmap and filters read the existing snapshot in memory.
`SkillHistorySection.tsx` is the component that calls `list_skill_events` and `restore_skill_event`.
A Restore success shows "Restored: {description}", a failure shows "Restore failed", and Reveal in Finder calls `open_skill_path(backup_path, "reveal")`.

## Changes in the Claude stack (#73 to #134)

PR #73 moved the event store itself — `event_store.rs`, the five-phase write path, and the reconcile logic — into `skill-studio-core`.
The desktop's `event_commands.rs` became a thin Tauri wrapper, and the new CLI and MCP server gained their own `restore`/events subcommands over the same core code.
`docs/spec-event-store.md` predates this split and still describes the pre-#73 module layout (`skills/event_store.rs`).
The schema, phases, and journal-kind list it documents did not change in the move, only their crate location.

## Changes in the Codex stack (#79 to #141)

PR #136, "Make Copy trial expiry and retained-backup Restore durable", routes Copy trial expiry through the shared core so it keeps a durable backup and removes the exact owned installation and its readers.
Activity and a notification can then restore that backup to Global as an untracked skill, including after the source project is unregistered.
An interrupted finalization settles the same event on restart.

PR #141, "Keep Activity History reads bounded and current", changes `list_skill_events`'s read path.
It moves onto a bounded background worker with at most two admitted reads; excess requests get `history_busy`.
The frontend shares identical pending requests, and results are invalidated when the snapshot changes or a restore finishes, so a stale read cannot overwrite current history.
Paging becomes 20 rows within the existing 200-event window.

PR #111, "show unresolved recovery status on Home", fixes a case this document's own current-state section implies is possible.
Home could show "All clear" while Activity still had an unresolved, interrupted-or-failed, unreverted operation.
The fix reads all history, not just the newest 200 rows, off the UI thread, and withholds the clear message while that read is loading or unavailable.

## Unit 1.2: the core Journal port

`skill-studio-core` now has a second, lower-level write-safety primitive alongside the SQLite event store above: the `Journal` port (`crates/skill-studio-core/src/ports.rs:627`) and its reference filesystem implementation, `FsJournal` (`crates/skill-studio-core/src/journal.rs:42`).
It journals `fsops`'s primitives (Stage, Swap, Link, WriteFile) directly, one row per `PlanRecord` (`ports.rs:602`) rather than per Tauri command, so a future `ops` function can compose several `fsops` calls into one plan and still get one journal row for the whole plan.

A plan is `Pending`, `Done`, `Failed`, `Reversed`, or `Interrupted` (`PlanStatus`, `ports.rs`).
`FsJournal::begin` writes the backup manifest, then the plan file, both through `ScopeFs` with an fsync-then-rename each, before the caller's first mutating step; the row starts `Pending`.
Each of `fsops`'s four primitives (`stage`, `swap`, `link`, `write_file`) now takes the open plan (a `&PlanWriter`) directly and records its own step _before_ it runs its own mutation, with everything reversal will need already computed and durable: `stage` records its temp path before creating it; `swap` records the exchange's chosen quarantine path (and the staged folder's pre-exchange device/inode, so reversal can later tell whether the exchange landed) before running it; `link` records the previous target (and the new one) before renaming the new link into place; `write_file` fsyncs its backup of the previous bytes before renaming the new ones into place. There is no separate `journaled_*` wrapper to call instead, and no textual pin on call sites either — the `&PlanWriter` parameter itself is the guarantee a caller cannot run a primitive without a step landing for it, since there is no way to get one in scope without a plan already open.
The caller finishes the plan `Done` or `Failed` after the last step.
`link` also refuses to run at all when something other than a symlink already sits at the target path (a plain rename would silently replace and lose it), rather than recording and running a rename reversal could never undo.

`reconcile` (`journal.rs`) is the startup pass: every plan still `Pending` is resolved, newest first (LIFO) — two plans stacked on the same path must unwind in the reverse of the order they applied, or the older plan's landed check sees the newer plan's result still there, wrongly calls itself never-landed, and the folder it should have restored is stranded in its own quarantine.
A pending plan with no recorded steps means nothing was mutated yet, so it resolves `Failed`.
A pending plan with at least one recorded step means the process died mid-plan — and because every step is recorded before its mutation, that crash can only ever land between "recorded" and "mutation landed", never the other way around. `reconcile` inspects the disk for each step, in reverse order, to tell whether its mutation actually landed, and reverses only what did, through the same `ScopeFs`: stage's `remove_tree` is already a no-op when nothing landed; swap checks the live path's device/inode against the staged folder's pre-exchange identity, then exchanges the quarantined tree back (or, when the exchange landed but the follow-up move into quarantine did not, exchanges the staged path back and lets the paired stage step's own reversal clean it up) or removes what is at `path`; link checks whether the path is currently a symlink pointing at the new target before restoring (or removing) the previous one; write_file compares the live bytes against the backup before restoring them (or deleting the file if there was none). Every path a step names is confined under the plan's own root first, so a corrupt or hand-edited row can never make reversal touch something outside it — a step naming an escaped path aborts reversal immediately, naming that path. A fully reversed plan resolves `Reversed`; if reversal itself hits an error (an escaped path, or an I/O error such as missing backup bytes), the plan resolves `Interrupted` and is listed with that error for the caller to act on.
No plan is ever deleted.

`trim_backups` (`journal.rs`) enforces a `BackupQuota` (max total bytes and max age) by trimming the oldest backups first — age violations before size violations — using each plan's `created_at` as its backups' age, since a backup has no timestamp of its own.

The desktop's `EventStore` (`apps/desktop/src-tauri/src/skills/event_store.rs`) is now the host implementation of this port directly: `impl Journal for EventStore` delegates every method to the `FsJournal` it already owns (rooted at `<app_data>/journal` over `skill_studio_host::RealFs`), rather than reimplementing plan storage on SQLite — the `EventStore::journal()` getter this used to be exposed through is gone. `run()`'s startup `spawn_blocking` now calls `skill_studio_core::journal::reconcile` against `&store` too, right after the SQLite five-phase reconciliation (`reconcile_core_journal_at_startup`, `lib.rs`), holding the same root `WriteLease` every other mutating command takes.
This is still additive: the SQLite five-phase write path described above is untouched, and no existing command has been rerouted through this `Journal` yet — that adoption is a later slice, once `ops` functions exist to call `fsops`'s primitives from. Today's startup reconcile against it is a no-op in practice for that reason; it exists so a crash mid-write is already covered on the day a command does route through it.

## Desired state

The eight-command journal rule should become the only rule: every mutating command records a journal event with a backup and an inverse before it touches disk, not eight of roughly twenty.
`set_harness_enabled`, `set_plugin_enabled`, and `set_skill_invocation` are the highest-value gaps, since the map already flags them partial-state risk without journaling.
`park_skill`, `unpark_skill`, `update_skill`, and `remove_skill` are named directly in the map's cross-check as success toasts hiding an unjournaled partial-state risk.

`list_skill_events` and `restore_skill_event` already live in `skill-studio-core` after #73.
Keep new event-store logic there, rather than growing a second copy in the desktop crate, so the CLI, MCP server, and desktop stay on one write path.

`ForkMutationLock` guards `restore_skill_event` the same way it guards every command in enable-and-links.md.
It should become the same per-scope lease described there, scoped to the event's target skill or deployment, so a restore of skill A does not block a concurrent journaled write to skill B.

Backups accumulate under `backups/<event-id>/` with no retention limit in the current design.
A retention policy, age- or count-bounded, is needed before the store grows unbounded on an active install.
`restore_skill_event`'s displaced-bytes backups should count the same as originals under that policy.

The startup reconcile's three repairers are each a compensating step for one journaled command.
As more commands journal, each needs its own repairer, named per the pattern `reconcile_interrupted_<kind>`, so a crash window is always covered by name rather than by the catch-all `pending -> interrupted` flip alone.

Restore feedback should keep naming the partial state precisely, the way the drift-guard dialog already does: "the current (drifted) content will itself be backed up and restorable".
That is the model for the "errors never swallowed, partial results named" principle, and it should extend to `set_harness_enabled` and `set_skill_invocation` once they journal.

`list_skill_events` needs a direct test.
Today only the DTO policy test at `event_commands.rs:640` and the restore-of-restore tests inside `event_store.rs` exercise it indirectly.

## Gaps

- Only eight of roughly twenty mutating commands journal; `set_harness_enabled`, `set_plugin_enabled`, and `set_skill_invocation` are the ones this map already flags as partial-state risk without a journal.
- `park_skill`, `unpark_skill`, `update_skill`, and `remove_skill` give a success toast that the map's own cross-check calls an unjournaled partial-state risk.
- `ForkMutationLock` is one global lock, not a per-scope lease, for `restore_skill_event` and every journaled command.
- Backups under `backups/<event-id>/` have no retention limit.
- Startup reconcile has three named repairers for the commands that journal today; new journaled commands need their own repairer, not a shared catch-all.
- `list_skill_events` has no direct test.
- `docs/spec-event-store.md` describes the pre-#73 module path (`skills/event_store.rs`) and should be updated to name the `skill-studio-core` location.
- Activity itself calls no Tauri command; History (`SkillHistorySection.tsx`) is a separate component from Activity, so a user reading Activity does not see the same live event feed History offers unless they navigate there.
