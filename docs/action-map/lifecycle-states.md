# Skill lifecycle states

One installed skill moves through a fixed set of states, and each state has its own combination of disk layout, registry record, and UI signal.
A state is a fact about the disk first; the registry and the UI both follow what a scan of the shared root and the per-harness links finds.

## States

| State                                | On disk                                                                                                                                                                                                    | UI                                                                                              |

| Malformed frontmatter                | SKILL.md fails a frontmatter check; nothing on disk changes until repair runs                                                                                                                              | `SkillFrontmatterRepairDialog`, driven by the `spec_violations` flag                            |

| Trashed (restorable)                 | Moved under `~/.agents/skills-trash/`; registry record dropped except what restore needs                                                                                                                   | Trial-expiry toast Restore button, or a manual restore call                                     |
| Pack member                          | Skill folder lives inside the pack's own git repo at `~/.agents/packs/<name>`; a pack row in the registry lists member skill names                                                                         | PacksView row, expanded to show members, behind the `skill-packs` flag                          |

## Transitions

Five background loops can move a skill between states without a user click: the trial-expiry loop runs 15 seconds after startup and then every 5 minutes; the update-check loop runs every 6 hours; startup reconcile runs once, at launch, before any of the others; pack-staging reconcile also runs once, synchronously, before the loops start; and the refresh loop rebuilds the in-memory snapshot on demand but writes no state of its own. The diagram below marks only the two loops that change a skill's lifecycle state.

## Per-harness view of one state

Each harness has its own discovery path, and the shared root under `.agents/skills` is the one location every first-class harness can read from without a copy: Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode, and pi each add a project or global path of their own on top of it. The three states below show how the same shared-root change reads differently per harness.

**Enabled.** Claude Code: symlink under `~/.claude/skills/<name>` resolves to the shared root; loads. Codex: reads the shared root directly by its own path convention; loads. OpenCode: same, its own skills path resolves; loads. pi: same; loads. Shared root: the entry exists under `~/.agents/skills/<name>`, the source of truth every harness link or read points back to.

**Disabled in Codex only.** Claude Code: link untouched; loads. Codex: `~/.codex/config.toml` marks the skill disabled (`skill_harness_disable.rs:741`); does not load. OpenCode: config untouched; loads. pi: untouched; loads. Shared root: entry unchanged, still present.

**Parked.** Claude Code: its link is removed as part of the park; does not load. Codex: no entry at the shared root's normal path to read, since the folder moved to `skills-parked/`; does not load. OpenCode: same; does not load. pi: same; does not load. Shared root: the entry itself moved to `~/.agents/skills-parked/<name>`, so no harness sees it at the expected path.

## Invariants

A doctor pass checks the disk against these six invariants, independent of any single command's own rollback logic, so a violation left by an old bug or a manual edit surfaces even when no command is running.

1. Every link resolves inside its root. Checked: `doctor::check_link_resolves_in_root` (`crates/skill-studio-core/src/doctor.rs`) reuses `diagnose`'s own broken-link detection and is wired into `ops::fix_skill`; naming the offending path is detect-only, the repair itself is desktop's journaled `repair_skill_link`, not duplicated in core.
2. Every registry entry has a folder. Checked: `doctor::check_registry_entry_has_folder`, wired into `ops::fix_skill`; detect-only, repair is `fix_skill`'s deferred follow-up.
3. Every lockfile entry has a folder. Checked: `doctor::check_lockfile_entry_has_folder`, resolved through the scanned `Inventory`'s own deployments (not a fixed path guess), wired into `ops::fix_skill`; detect-only.
4. No folder is in two states at once (for example parked and trashed). Checked: `doctor::check_no_folder_in_two_states`, resolved through the scanned `Inventory`'s deployments across every root, wired into `ops::fix_skill`; detect-only.
5. Quarantine stays within a retention cap. Checked (detect-only): `doctor::check_quarantine_within_cap` reports the quarantine path, its entry count, and the cap, wired into `ops::fix_skill`. Pruning is not implemented here - it needs a lease and a journal entry to be safe, which is unit 3.9's scope.
6. The journal has no open plan at rest. Partly checked: `reconcile_at_startup` (`event_store.rs:351`) flips every pending row to `interrupted` and runs three repairers on launch (`lib.rs:26`, `:48-96`), but this only covers the 8 commands that journal today. `doctor::check_journal_has_no_open_plan` exists and is exercised by tests, but has no caller inside `ops::fix_skill`: the core's `Journal` port is `Send`-only (desktop's `EventStore` wraps a non-`Sync` `rusqlite::Connection`), so widening `Ports` to carry a `Journal` for cross-thread use would break that impl; wiring this in is left as a follow-up.

Nothing in this file changes what a scan reports; it only names the states a scan's output already implies.

## Gaps

- Park, unpark, fork, pull, and unfork write no journal event; only `make_skill_independent_copy`, `set_deployment_enabled`, `materialize_harness_root`, `set_shared_harness_skill_enabled`, and `repair_skill_link` do.
- All lifecycle-changing commands share one process-wide `ForkMutationLock`; a transition on one skill blocks an unrelated transition on another.
- `park_skill` and `unpark_skill`'s rollback writes use `let _ =`, discarding the result instead of checking or repairing it.
- `pull_fork_upstream`'s four-rename swap has no transaction boundary; a crash between renames is a named, unrepaired risk.
- `unfork_skill` writes the registry after the CLI reinstall already discarded local edits, so a write failure leaves a stale fork record.
- Invariants 1-5 now have a detect-only doctor pass (`crates/skill-studio-core/src/doctor.rs`), wired into `ops::fix_skill`; none of the five repairs itself from core. Invariant 6's `check_journal_has_no_open_plan` still has no caller in `fix_skill` - see the Invariants section above.
- Trashed, parked, and fork-snapshot directories accumulate with no retention limit or scheduled cleanup.
- `restore_trashed_skill` does not clean up a half-written target or the trash copy when its entry-count check fails.
- The header Remove button's success toast reads "Updated N deployments," which does not name the Removing-to-Not-installed transition it just completed.
- `check_skill_updates_now` has no UI caller; the Update-available state can only be reached through the 6-hour background loop.
