> Historical snapshot. `set_harness_enabled` was removed in #387; Park is now the only way to turn a skill off.

# Primitives and the call stack

The eight primitives, how each user job is a short sequence of them, and where each harness's own facts enter. The rule that shapes this file: use the tools the user already has. The app never re-implements a fetch, a merge, or a plugin manager; it calls `npx skills`, `git`, `gh`, `claude plugin`, and the user's editor, and owns only the safe placement of files and the record of what it did.

## The primitives

Every write is: plan (pure, from a Snapshot) → Lease → Journal(plan) → steps → Journal(done) → event. The plan is a value the tests can assert on without touching disk.

Fork, independent copy, park, and remove all reduce to Swap and Link with a registry row. That is the sharing the user asked for: one implementation of "move a folder safely" serves every job.

                          desktop: skills://event ---> store applies the event ---> one row re-renders
```

The three surfaces share one `ops` function and one request type. The frontend applies the event to the row it already has; it does not wait for a full snapshot. The full snapshot follows from the background refresh when the watcher sees the change.

## Where each harness enters

A harness is a data table plus five small functions behind one trait:

```
trait HarnessAdapter {
    fn facts(&self) -> &HarnessFacts;          // roots, depth, links, switches, with Evidence per row
    fn detect(&self, probe: &dyn Probe) -> Detection;
    fn roots(&self, home: &Path, project: Option<&Path>) -> Vec<RootSpec>;
    fn read_switch(&self, fs: &dyn Fs, skill: &SkillRef) -> SwitchState;
    fn write_switch(&self, fs: &dyn Fs, skill: &SkillRef, on: bool) -> Plan;
    fn usage_reader(&self) -> Box<dyn UsageReader>;
}
```

`ops` never names a harness. It asks the catalog for every adapter, and each adapter answers from its table. Adding a harness is one file with one table, one fixture home, and five functions; nothing in `ops` changes. Cursor and Grok Build are adapters with `detect` and `roots` only until someone captures their usage format.

## What this replaces

Today each desktop module carries its own write path: skill_park.rs, skill_fork.rs, skill_independent_copy.rs, skill_harness_disable.rs, skill_materialize.rs, event_commands.rs, and the legacy paths in commands.rs and skill_add.rs. Each lands its own rename, its own registry write, and its own idea of undo. The map in README.md counts 46 writes with 8 journaled. Under this file, every one of them is a plan over the same eight primitives, and the journal is not optional.
