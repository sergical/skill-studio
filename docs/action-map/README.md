# Action map

This folder describes every action the desktop app can take, area by area. Each file answers four questions about one area: what the code does today, what the Claude stack changed, what the Codex stack changed, and where we want it to be.

Source: a read of `apps/desktop/src-tauri/src/skills/` and `apps/desktop/src` on 2026-09-16, on the branch `feat/activity-narrow-layout` at the tip of the Claude stack (#134). The full per-command table is published at https://claude.ai/artifact/K5s4TezGohKPfmiWVFP7ZP.

These files cut across the areas. Read them before the area files if you are new to the code.

## Per-harness files

One file per harness under [harnesses/](harnesses/). Each answers: how the app knows the harness is present, where skills live, how it loads a skill, how the app turns a skill off, how a use shows up in activity, and what the core must handle.

## Scope for the first release

Assistant runs (Ask, Audit, Test) and packs are deferred. Their area files stay in this folder, and the core API must stay usable by them, but no unit in plan.md builds them. The scope decision is recorded in user-stories.md and plan.md.

## How to read one file

Each file has the same five sections.

1. **Current state.** What runs, in what order it writes, what lock it takes, whether it records a journal event, how it fails, what the code does on failure, what the user sees, and which tests exist. Lines cite `file:line` from the read on 2026-09-16.
2. **Changes in the Claude stack (#73 to #134).** What the open pull requests from #73 to #134 changed in this area. These are our own changes.
3. **Changes in the Codex stack (#79 to #141).** What the open pull requests from #79 to #141 changed in this area. This section reports only. It does not set the design.
4. **Desired state.** Where we want the area to be. Every file applies the same rules, listed below.
5. **Gaps.** One line per difference between current and desired, with the command name.

## The rules the desired state applies

- Every write records a journal event with a backup and an inverse before it touches disk.
- One write path lives in the core crate. The desktop command is a thin adapter over it.
- Writes take a per-scope lease, not one global try-acquire lock.
- The registry file `~/.agents/skill-studio.json` is read, changed, and written under that same lease.
- A chained write is one transaction, or each step has a compensating step.
- Success feedback appears only after the last step. Errors are never swallowed. Partial results are named to the user.
- Every install path shows the repository trust prompt.
- Backups have a retention limit.
- Every command has a direct test and a crash-window test.
- No IPC command exists without a caller.

## Headline numbers from the 2026-09-16 read

| Measure                                  | Count |
| ---------------------------------------- | ----- |
| Tauri commands                           | 62    |
| Commands that write                      | 46    |
| Writes that record a journal event       | 9     |
| Commands with no direct test             | 23    |
| Commands with a named partial-state risk | 35    |
| Commands with no frontend caller         | 2     |
| UI controls mapped                       | 110   |

## Keeping this map true

This map was read by hand. Nothing checks it against the code. When a command is added, removed, or changes its write order, edit the file for its area in the same pull request. The build does not fail when the map is stale, so the review has to catch it.
