# Existing workflow contracts

Status: Source-audited baseline for the shared-core migration. Runtime acceptance remains unverified.

Date: 2026-09-08.

This document accompanies [Shared core, headless access, performance, and observability](./spec-headless-performance-observability.md). It records the behavior that migration must preserve. It does not add every desktop operation to the first CLI release. Hosted MCP is out of scope.

Each migrated workflow requires a fixture that checks its eligible sources, destinations, ownership changes, file or link effects, failure behavior, and actual restore capability. Unsupported combinations remain unsupported unless a separate product change specifies them. Resource descriptions are qualitative, not measured memory or latency.

## How a skill can enter the application

Adding has four independent choices: source, install method, destination, and lifetime. Only supported combinations should appear in each adapter.

### Entry and source choices

| User workflow                                   | Current behavior and effects                                                                  | Why it is useful                                         | Main resource cost                                 |
| ----------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Browse the Skill Store                          | Fetch popular/list results, open details, select an existing skill to install                 | Discover a skill without knowing its repository          | Network response size, result and detail rendering |
| Search the Skill Store                          | Query the catalogue; install using the recorded source                                        | Find a named capability                                  | Network and search result rendering                |
| Paste a repository/source identifier            | Add sheet parses an existing source, then resolves available skills and methods               | Install a source outside catalogue browsing              | Repository metadata lookup or fetch                |
| GitHub owner/repository, subpath, tree/blob URL | Resolve repository, ref/path, and skill selection                                             | Pin or select a specific skill source                    | Network, archive extraction, staging               |
| skills.sh URL or supported Git URL              | Normalize the source and use a compatible install method                                      | Reuse a link someone shared                              | Source resolution and installer work               |
| Local absolute or home-relative path            | Use an existing local source through a supported method                                       | Install local development or offline content             | Directory reads/copies and validation              |
| Select several skills from a repository         | Start a batch operation with per-item outcomes; batch Copy can share one fetched snapshot     | Avoid repeated selection and repeated repository fetches | One repository snapshot plus per-skill writes      |
| Import a pack                                   | Resolve a pack and pinned source, preflight trust, then install its contents                  | Reproduce a curated skill set                            | Snapshot, validation, installer/copy work          |
| Install outside Skill Studio                    | Filesystem discovery finds skills from external installers, manual folders, and plugin caches | Adopt an existing setup                                  | Background discovery and classification            |

The current UI does not expose blank skill creation, pasting a complete SKILL.md body as a new skill, or drag-and-drop folder import. Editing an installed SKILL.md is available. Sources and methods are separate: accepting a URL does not mean every install method works for it. [Add sheet](/Users/sergiydybskiy/src/agent-studio/apps/desktop/src/components/AddSkill/AddSkillSheet.tsx:1197), [conventions](/Users/sergiydybskiy/src/agent-studio/docs/agent-skill-conventions.md)

### Install method and ownership

| Method           | Persistent effects                                                                            | Updates and later edits                                                          |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Dotagents        | Runs the owning CLI and records its managed source/lock state; may add Claude per-skill links | Managed update/removal follows dotagents. Forking is a separate ownership change |
| skills.sh CLI    | Runs `npx skills`; uses its managed lock state and supported agent destinations               | Managed update/removal follows the owning CLI                                    |
| Copy             | Writes local files without an upstream install manager owning them                            | Independent edits are possible; do not promise managed update behavior           |
| Pack import      | Uses pack provenance and bundled content through its import operation                         | Imported items' actual ownership determines later update/removal behavior        |
| Plugin discovery | Reads a plugin's installed cache and provenance; no new skill installation occurs             | Plugin-owned content is treated as managed/read-only in the inspected UI         |

The dispatch and source-specific behavior live in [skill_add.rs](/Users/sergiydybskiy/src/agent-studio/apps/desktop/src-tauri/src/skills/skill_add.rs:1123). Destination arguments are built in [skill_install_plan.rs](/Users/sergiydybskiy/src/agent-studio/apps/desktop/src-tauri/src/skills/skill_install_plan.rs:27).

### Destination and lifetime

| Choice                   | Effect                                                                                                                |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Global Universal         | One shared skill under the user's shared root; agents that read that root see it. Claude may need a per-skill symlink |
| Project Universal        | Shared deployment belongs to the selected project rather than the global root                                         |
| Per-harness Copy         | Independent folders for selected harnesses. The plan requires at least one harness and permits Copy only              |
| Permanent                | No trial expiry record                                                                                                |
| Trial                    | Supported Universal installation with a trial record. Per-harness trials are rejected                                 |
| Keep a trial             | Removes the trial record while leaving the installation in place                                                      |
| Trial expiry             | Moves the skill to the app's skills-trash area and emits an expiry event                                              |
| Restore an expired trial | Copies it back as unmanaged content and restores applicable Claude visibility                                         |

A shared installation is not a claim that every agent has identical discovery or enable/disable behavior. Claude whole-directory links, native configuration formats, and independent project copies need distinct handling.

## Current user workflow inventory

This table lists user-facing capabilities and their effects. Every resource entry is qualitative. Per-workflow memory still needs measurement.

Important boundaries:

- The current UI has no plugin install/disable manager and no visible pack member add/remove editor.
- Invocation observations are not complete proof of usage across all agents. The current refresh reads Claude project transcripts; missing observations must not be labeled as proof that a skill was never used.
- Model invocation costs and SKILL.md token counts are not application CPU/RAM metrics.
- History is not universal undo. Some recorded events have no safe inverse. The UI offers restore based on the event's actual capability.
- Pi, Cursor and Grok do not have a native per-harness visibility switch in the inspected implementation.
- Agent runners currently target Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode and pi. Discovery support for another agent does not establish support for launching it.
