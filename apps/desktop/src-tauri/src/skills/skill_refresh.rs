// ============================================================================
// Skills Module - Background Refresh
// "Never stale, never blocks": a background std thread builds a
// `SkillSnapshot` at startup, stores it in managed state, and rebuilds it
// whenever the filesystem sources it depends on change (skill roots, plugin
// caches, the lock file, Codex config, Claude Code transcripts). Every
// command that needs the current skills reads the cached snapshot instead of
// re-scanning the filesystem on the calling thread.
