// ============================================================================
// Skills Module - skill_fork_registry
// Reads and writes `~/.agents/skill-studio.json`, the one Skill-Studio-owned
// file inside `~/.agents` - the app never touches `agents.toml`,
// `agents.lock`, or `.skill-lock.json` itself, those belong to the owning
// CLI. Tracks which skills have been detached from their ledger ("forked")
// so local edits survive `dotagents sync` / `npx skills update`, plus a
// `parked` bucket for skills disabled globally (see `skill_park`), and a
// `harness_disabled` bucket for the one per-harness disable that has no
// native config to read back from (Claude Code - see `skill_harness_disable`).
// A missing file yields a
// default (empty) registry; an unreadable or malformed one is an error for
// every mutating command (fork/pull/unfork/remove), since silently treating
// it as empty would erase every recorded fork on the next write. Read-only
// callers (snapshot/candidate building) use `read_fork_registry_or_default`
// instead, which downgrades that same error to a logged warning.
