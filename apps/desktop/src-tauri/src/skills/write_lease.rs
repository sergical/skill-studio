// Skill Studio - write_lease
// Replaces the desktop's old process-wide mutation mutex (fork, park,
// unpark, harness-disable, add, and frontmatter-repair writes all used to
// serialize on it). `WriteLease` is a `FileLease` keyed to the root
// the write touches (`home` for every one of today's call sites), so a
// concurrent CLI or MCP write on the same root serializes with the desktop
// too - a global in-process mutex never could.
