//! Cross-surface parity for `fix_skill`: the CLI's `fix` subcommand, the
//! MCP server's `fix` tool, and the desktop's `fix_skill` Tauri command
//! (`skills/skill_fix.rs`) are each a thin adapter calling
//! `skill_studio_core::ops::fix_skill` on a `Runtime` built the same way.
//! The MCP server shares the CLI's own runtime builder
//! (`apps/cli/src/main.rs`'s `build_runtime_write`, called from
//! `apps/mcp`), so proving CLI/desktop parity here also covers MCP - there
//! is no third construction to test separately. This test runs the real
//! `skill-studio` CLI binary (`skill-studio-cli`'s `fix` subcommand,
//! `--home` pointed at a fixture) for the CLI/MCP side, and the desktop
//! adapter's own `core_runtime::build_runtime_write_at` for the desktop
//! side, over two byte-identical copies of the same fixture, and proves
//! `fix_skill` leaves both trees byte-identical, so no surface's adapter
//! has drifted from the shared op.
//!
//! Red check performed by hand while writing this test (not left in the
//! tree): temporarily added `std::fs::write(a.path.join("SKILL.md"), ...)`
//! inside `ops::conflicts_in`'s conflict branch, simulating a regression
//! that writes on a conflict instead of only reporting it; the parity test
//! below failed on a hash mismatch for `dup-skill`, confirming the checksum
//! comparison actually catches a conflict that writes. Reverted before
//! committing.
//!
//! Coverage gap (G5, review round 2): the fixture here has no `OpenCode`
//! skills, so it never exercises the difference between
//! `core_runtime.rs`'s `opencode_config_dir(home)` (desktop) and
//! `scope.rs`'s `opencode_config_dir_under(home)` (CLI) - if those two
//! ever resolve a different directory for the same `home`, this test
//! would not catch it. Tracked in `issue-3.7b-followup-a.md`.
