# Fails when a release is missing any artifact a complete two-architecture
# macOS release must carry.
#
# release.yml builds aarch64 and x86_64 in two matrix legs, and both legs
# upload to the same release with tauri-action. The release is created as a
# draft and is published only from a final job that runs this script first, so
# a leg that failed (or any step that failed after an upload) can never leave a
# public release that only carries one architecture. This asserts, from the
# release's own uploaded assets, that both legs landed: four DMGs (versioned and fixed-name), two updater
# archives with their signatures, the two dSYM archives, the two signed CLI
# archives that the npm-publish job repackages, and a latest.json
# that names both darwin-aarch64 and darwin-x86_64. A single-target
# latest.json is exactly the dead end the updater hits when the other
# architecture is missing.
