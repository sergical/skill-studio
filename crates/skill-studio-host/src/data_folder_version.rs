//! The app data folder's `schema_version` marker and its forward migration
//! (`docs/action-map/plan.md` unit 6.3).
//!
//! The data folder (Tauri's `app_data_dir`) holds the event store, the
//! timing log, and backups; a folder with no marker file is version 0
//! ("pre-versioned" - the layout every folder had before this unit
//! shipped). [`migrate`] runs the table in [`STEPS`] one entry at a time,
//! in order, and writes the marker only after every step's own files are
//! durably in place - so a crash mid-migration always leaves the marker
//! reading the version it started at, never a version whose files are
//! only partly written.
//!
//! [`Fs`] is this module's own read/write seam, not `skill-studio-core`'s
//! `ScopeFs`: that port's `confine` keys every path to a `RuntimeScope`'s
//! home and project roots, and the app data folder isn't one of those -
//! inventing a scope root for one well-known file would add confinement
//! machinery with no safety benefit here. `skill-studio-host` is allowed to
//! touch `std::fs` directly (only the core crate is not), so [`RealFs`]
//! does.
