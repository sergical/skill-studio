//! Skill-use index: parses each enabled harness's own session history for
//! skill uses and keeps a per-source cache so a refresh only re-reads what
//! changed. Two kinds of source exist: append-only JSONL transcripts,
//! resumed from a byte offset (Claude Code, Codex), and `SQLite` databases,
//! re-queried from a `time_updated` watermark (`OpenCode`). Read discipline
//! mirrors `discovery.rs`: only regular files are opened, each transcript
//! line is capped so a pathological line can't be buffered in full, and a
//! file/run byte budget bounds worst-case I/O per refresh.
//!
//! A transcript source's `parse` function takes a
//! [`TranscriptContext`](skill_studio_core::skill_uses::TranscriptContext),
//! carried across lines and (for a resumed, not reparsed, file) across
//! refreshes - Codex states its session id and project path once, in a
//! header line, rather than repeating them on every line the way Claude Code
//! does.
//!
//! `SOURCES` is the table of harnesses this index reads from: Claude Code,
//! pi, and Cursor each watch one transcript root; Codex watches two
//! (`sessions`, `archived_sessions`); `OpenCode` reads its `SQLite` databases
//! instead of JSONL; Grok Build watches `.grok/sessions` and only lists a
//! session's `updates.jsonl` once its `summary.json` also exists. Adding a
//! harness later means adding a row, not reworking `refresh`.
