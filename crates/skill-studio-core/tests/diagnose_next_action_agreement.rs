//! `diagnose` must never propose an action that the named operation refuses.
//!
//! This is the invariant behind a real regression: `diagnose` told the user to
//! run `preview_frontmatter_repair` on a hand-made skill with broken
//! frontmatter, and `preview_frontmatter_repair` answered `unsupported`
//! ("deployment is read-only"), because the core's gate had dropped the
//! desktop's carve-out for `Manual` owners. Both operations passed their own
//! tests. Only the pair was wrong.
//!
//! So the assertion here is over the pair, across every fixture: take every
//! `NextAction` that `diagnose` emits, invoke the operation it names, and
//! require that the operation accepts it. A next action the user cannot act on
//! is worse than no next action at all.
