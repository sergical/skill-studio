//! fsops: five primitives for durable, confined writes under one root
//! folder - [`Root`], [`stage`], [`swap`], [`link`], and [`write_file`].
//! See `docs/action-map/primitives-and-call-stack.md` for the guarantee
//! each one makes and `docs/action-map/plan.md` unit 1.1 for the tests
//! that hold them to it.
//!
//! Nothing in [`crate::ops`] calls these yet; adoption starts in a later
//! unit. Every primitive is written against the `fsops_*` methods on
//! [`crate::ports::ScopeFs`], so this module never touches the real
//! filesystem - `skill_studio_host::fs::RealFs` and
//! `crate::testing::FixtureFs` are the two implementations, real disk and
//! in-memory.
//!
//! [`stage`], [`swap`], [`link`], and [`write_file`] each take a
//! [`crate::journal::PlanWriter`] and record their own step against it
//! *before* their mutation runs, with the reversal data (the staged path's
//! identity, the previous link target, the fsynced backup) computed and
//! made durable first - see `docs/action-map/plan.md` unit 1.2. The
//! `&PlanWriter` parameter is itself the guarantee that a caller cannot run
//! one of these four without a plan step landing for it: there is no way to
//! call `stage`, `swap`, `link`, or `write_file` without one in scope, and
//! getting one in scope means a plan is already open. That is a
//! compile-time property, not something a test needs to re-check by
//! grepping call sites.
