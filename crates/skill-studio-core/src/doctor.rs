//! The six doctor invariants named in `docs/action-map/lifecycle-states.md`'s
//! Invariants section, checked independently of any single command's own
//! rollback logic so a violation left by an old bug or a manual edit
//! surfaces even when no command is running. [`ops::fix_skill`] runs checks
//! 1-5 and applies whichever repair exists; anything it cannot repair is
//! returned as a [`DoctorViolation`] naming the path.
//!
//! Invariant 6 ([`JournalHasNoOpenPlan`](DoctorInvariant::JournalHasNoOpenPlan))
//! has a repair the core can run safely on its own
//! (`crate::journal::reconcile`, run at startup). Invariants 1-5 are
//! detect-only here: invariant 1's repair is the desktop's journaled
//! `repair_skill_link`, not duplicated in core; invariant 5's repair (prune
//! quarantine to its retention cap) is unit 3.9's, which owns "quarantine
//! with a retention cap" - pruning without a lease or a journal entry is not
//! safe to do from here. [`crate::ownership::HomeRegistry`] and
//! [`crate::lock_file::SkillLockFile`] are partial views of documents whose
//! full shape (trials, parked records, packs, ...) core does not own -
//! `crate::registry`'s own doc comment says as much - so writing either
//! back from here would silently drop fields core never read. Repairing
//! those two is `ops::fix_skill`'s deferred follow-up; this module still
//! detects and names them.
