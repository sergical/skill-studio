//! `ops::remove`: takes one mutable deployment off disk, for all four owner
//! kinds `LifecycleOwnerKind::is_mutable` allows (`Copy`, `Fork`,
//! `Dotagents`, `SkillsSh`) - `docs/action-map/primitives-and-call-stack.md`'s
//! Remove row.
//!
//! `Copy`/`Fork` hold their own bytes, so this op renames the deployment's
//! directory straight into `<universal_root>/.skill-studio-quarantine/`
//! (never deletes it) - the same direct-`rename` shape `ops::park` already
//! uses to move a deployment out of the universal root, not
//! `fsops::stage`/`swap`: `swap` always *replaces* the final name with a
//! staged folder, and remove has no replacement to put there (see
//! `fsops::swap`'s own doc comment). `Dotagents`/`SkillsSh` call
//! `npx ... remove <name>` through the process-spawner port and let the CLI
//! delete its own files, matching `ops_install`'s `Dotagents`/`SkillsSh`
//! path and the desktop's current behavior (`docs/action-map/remove-and-
//! update.md`'s current-state table: neither variant quarantines today).
//!
//! Every branch records its journal row - with an archival `backup_paths`
//! copy of the deployment's tree - before the first write, matching
//! `ops::park`. Unlike `park`, this op's `inverse` is a real
//! `restore_backup_inverse` for every branch: `BackupEntry::is_dir` lets the
//! generic `restore_event`/`RestorePlan::WriteDir` machinery replay a whole
//! directory tree back to its pre-remove bytes (see that field's own doc),
//! so a dedicated `unremove` op is not needed here the way `ops::unpark`
//! needed one.
//!
//! Quarantine retention: after a `Copy`/`Fork` removal, this op prunes the
//! oldest and the age-expired entries in the same universal root's
//! quarantine directory (see `prune_quarantine`'s own doc for both caps),
//! while still holding the exclusive lease this call already acquired -
//! `doctor::check_quarantine_within_cap` only detects the violation (see
//! that function's own doc: "pruning without a lease ... is not safe to do
//! from here"); this is that repair. Each prune that deletes at least one
//! entry gets its own `quarantine_prune` journal row.
