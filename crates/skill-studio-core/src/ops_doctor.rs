//! `ops::doctor`: one read-only pass over every lifecycle invariant named
//! in `docs/action-map/lifecycle-states.md`'s Invariants section, over the
//! whole scope the running `Runtime` knows - not one skill at a time, the
//! way `ops::fix_skill` runs invariants 1-5 scoped to a single skill while
//! repairing what it can. `doctor` repairs nothing; it only names what it
//! finds, so a caller running it at startup or on demand never mutates
//! disk.
//!
//! Invariants 1-4 are checked once per skill the scan found, over the
//! `Diagnosis`'s own `Inventory` (never a second `scan`, matching
//! `fix_skill`'s reuse of `diagnose`'s inventory). Invariant 5 (quarantine)
//! and invariant 6 (journal) each check one thing regardless of skill
//! count, so they run once each rather than once per skill.
//!
//! The journal is constructed here rather than threaded through `Ports`,
//! matching the shared brief's correction: `Ports` carries no `Journal`
//! field today, and `check_journal_has_no_open_plan` only needs to read
//! it, so `FsJournal::new(journal_root, fs)` at the read site is the
//! smaller seam than widening `Ports` for every caller.
