//! The lease-guarded write path for a JSON document an adapter stores
//! directly under a scope home - on the desktop, `~/.agents/skill-studio.json`
//! (see `skill_fork_registry.rs`).
//!
//! The document's own shape (forks, trials, parked skills, ...) stays with
//! the adapter that owns it, since it carries adapter-specific types the
//! core does not know about. This module owns only the write path: take the
//! exclusive lease over the document's home, bump a monotonic write
//! counter, write atomically. [`RegistryDocument::write_version`] is
//! distinct from any schema-format version field a document also carries
//! (the desktop's `ForkRegistry.version`, for example, marks a schema
//! migration and is set explicitly by the code that performs it) - this one
//! exists only so a lease loser can tell its in-memory copy went stale, per
//! `docs/action-map/harnesses/shared-root.md`, "What is not there yet".
