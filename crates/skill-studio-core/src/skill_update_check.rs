//! Currency ("update available") per install method - plan.md unit 3.4,
//! user-stories.md U4.
//!
//! Five rules, one per [`crate::identity::SourceKind`]: skills.sh compares
//! the lock file's `skillFolderHash` against the source repo's tree SHA at
//! HEAD, one [`SourceTreeLookup`] call per repo regardless of how many
//! skills within it are checked; dotagents compares the ledger's pinned
//! commit against the newest commit for the skill's path; plugin compares
//! the locally known cache version against the marketplace manifest; a fork
//! compares the home registry's `base_commit` against the newest commit for
//! its recorded upstream, pinned independently of whatever the ledger says
//! for the same name; manual (and anything else - `InRepo`, or a deployment
//! with no ledger owner) is never a candidate. Ported from the desktop's
//! `skill_update_check.rs`, which this replaces for the skills.sh
//! comparison: that file used to shell one `gh api` commits lookup per
//! skill; this reads the tree once per source repo instead.
